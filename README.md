This is a Mobile Application I developed using Java in Android Studio 2021. 
I used SQLite DataBase. It is an iteration of the popular game called "Flappy Bird".
You can log in and then choose a game mode The Day mode opens the Day version of the game with a Bird and the Night mode opens a night version with a Bat as the character.
The objective of the game is to go as far as you can by tapping the screen and avoiding the obstacles in the way. If you touch those obstacles or fall down, it is game over. 
I used simple techniques and coding principles to develop the game.
