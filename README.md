Hello, This is a Mobile Application developed by me using Java in Android Studio. I used SQLite DataBase. 
It is a game called Flappy Bird. You can log in and then choose a game mode
The Day mode opens the Day version of the game with a Bird and the Night mode opens a night version with a Bat as the character
The objective of the game is to go as far as you can by tapping the screen and avoiding the obstacles in the way. If you touch those obstacles or 
fall down, it is game over. I used simple techniques and coding principles to develop the game.
